# CodeAlpha_Sales-Prediction-using-Python
Sales Prediction using Machine Learning in Python involves predicting future sales based on historical data and other influencing factors such as advertising spend, customer demographics, product features, and market conditions. 

Key Steps:
1. Data Collection: Gather historical data, which includes features like ad spend (TV, social media, radio), audience characteristics (age, income), and sales figures.
   
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical data.

3. Feature Selection: Identify key factors that most significantly affect sales, such as marketing budget and target audience behavior.

4. Model Training: Use machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost to train a predictive model on this data.

5. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).

6. Prediction: Once trained, the model can predict future sales based on new data (e.g., new advertising campaign details).

This process helps businesses forecast sales, optimize marketing strategies, and make data-driven decisions to maximize revenue.
